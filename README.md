# Retail-Revenue-Prediction

We have been given a large dataset by Plaace, a Norwegian company that matches businesses to retail properties. They have provided us with revenue information for over 20,000 retail stores that will be used to train and evaluate your models. In addition, we have also been provided with a wide selection of supplementary data that can be used to engineer more powerful features, including geo-specific demographic, public transportation information, a hierarchical grouping of the stores, and information about over 28,000 additional stores.
